  "mission": "software-dev",
  "source_description": "Make each JSON config file a self-contained deployment unit. One JSON file describes one website: which venues to aggregate, where to deploy the generated site, and what template to use. The CLI accepts the JSON file path as a required argument. This enables running multiple independent deployments from the same codebase — food trucks, music venues, farmers markets, etc. — each producing a distinct live website.",
