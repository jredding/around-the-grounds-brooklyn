# WP03 — FR4 audit

## Goal
Confirm that zero `FoodTruckEvent` or `Brewery` import references remain in `parsers/` and that the registry is unchanged before opening the PR.

## Context
- Upstream-first: clean PR to around-the-grounds main
- Minimalism: only parser type signatures and field names change — no logic, no structure
- Prerequisite: spec 004 merged to main before implementing
- Branch: `005-adapter-interface-update`

## Subtasks
- [ ] Run: `grep -r "FoodTruckEvent" around_the_grounds/parsers/` → must return zero matches
- [ ] Run: `grep -r "from.*Brewery\|import.*Brewery" around_the_grounds/parsers/` → must return zero matches
- [ ] Confirm `parsers/registry.py` is unchanged (git diff must be empty for this file)
- [ ] Run: `uv run python -m pytest tests/parsers/` → all tests pass

## Files to change
No file changes — this is a verification-only step. It is the exit criterion for WP02, not a separate commit.

## Acceptance criteria
- `grep -r "FoodTruckEvent" around_the_grounds/parsers/` returns zero results
- `grep -r "from.*Brewery\|import.*Brewery" around_the_grounds/parsers/` returns zero results
- `git diff parsers/registry.py` is empty
- `uv run python -m pytest tests/parsers/` passes

## Reviewer notes
Per plan.md: WP03 is the exit criterion for WP02, not a separate deliverable. Run both
greps and the parser test suite before opening the PR. If either grep returns results,
return to WP02 and fix the missed parser before proceeding.
